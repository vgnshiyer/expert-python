### Notes:

- The send() method is similar to __next__() (next()), but additionally it allows to send a value to the generator.
- Calling any of these methods resumes a generator until the next yield statement. 
- Difference is, in case of send(), the generator also receives a value which can be used to modify the state of the generator.
